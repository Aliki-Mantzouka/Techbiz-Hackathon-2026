# 🤖 Multi-Channel HITL Gateway

Hackathon challenge by Microsoft: Human-in-the-Loop Governance for AI Agents. 

A work-in-progress Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) system that enables AI Agents to request human approval via multiple interactive channels (Discord, ntfy, Email). The system ensures Governance and a robust Audit Trail for critical business decisions.
